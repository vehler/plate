## Task Workflow

1. New tasks are created using the template in `templates/task-template.md`
2. Tasks start in `kanban/backlog.md`
3. When work begins on a task, it moves to `kanban/in-progress.md`
4. Once completed and awaiting review, tasks move to `kanban/review.md`
5. After approval, tasks are moved to `kanban/completed.md`

## Phase Overview

- **Phase 1:** Foundation Enhancement - Building on the Payload blank template
- **Phase 2:** Core Feature Enhancements - Building separate authentication systems
- **Phase 3:** Extended Features and Developer Experience - Advanced functionality and tooling
- **Phase 4:** Production Optimization and Documentation - MVP finalization and deployment preparation

## Task Priority Levels

- **P0:** Critical - Blocking project progress
- **P1:** High - Essential for the upcoming milestone
- **P2:** Medium - Important but not immediately blocking
- **P3:** Low - Nice to have, can be deferred

## Task Status Values

- **Backlog:** Not yet started
- **In Progress:** Currently being worked on
- **Review:** Awaiting review or testing
- **Completed:** Finished and approved
