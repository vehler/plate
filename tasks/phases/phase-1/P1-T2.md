# P1-T2: Enhance Docker Configuration

## Task Information

- **ID**: P1-T2
- **Title**: Enhance Docker Configuration
- **Phase**: 1
- **Priority**: P1
- **Status**: Completed
- **Assignee**: Windsurf
- **Due Date**: 2025-06-18
- **Started Date**: 2025-06-07
- **Completed Date**: 2025-06-07

## Task Description

Optimize and enhance the Docker configuration for both development and production environments. The current Docker setup provided by the Payload blank template is basic and needs to be improved to support our development workflow and production deployment requirements for the Plate boilerplate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Development Docker configuration optimized for efficient local development
- [x] Production Docker configuration created with multi-stage build for optimized size
- [x] MongoDB service configured with proper volume mounts and persistence
- [x] Environment variables properly handled in both development and production
- [x] Docker Compose files updated for dev and prod environments
- [x] Documentation updated with Docker usage instructions
- [x] Tested and verified working for both development and production scenarios

## Dependencies

- P1-T1 (Initialize Project with Payload Blank Template)

## Implementation Details

1. **Development Environment Enhancements**:
   - Optimize the existing docker-compose.yml for development
   - Add proper volume mounts for faster reload times
   - Configure environment variables with appropriate defaults
   - Add MongoDB initialization scripts for development data
   - Implement hot-reloading support for better developer experience

2. **Production Environment Setup**:
   - Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for production
   - Implement proper build caching for faster builds
   - Configure production-specific optimizations (e.g., output compression)
   - Set up appropriate environment variable handling
   - Minimize the final image size by removing development dependencies

3. **Common Improvements**:
   - Add health checks for all services
   - Configure proper logging settings
   - Setup network configurations
   - Add container resource limits

## Resources

- [Docker Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)
- [Payload CMS Deployment Documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment)
- [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
- [Project PRD](/Users/lennickvelez/Workspaces/plate/prd.md)

## Notes

This task is critical for establishing a consistent development environment and preparing for production deployment. The Docker configuration should align with the server-first architecture of Payload CMS v3 and ensure optimal performance in both development and production contexts.

- **Implementation Summary**: Enhanced Docker configuration for both development and production environments, improving security, maintainability, and deployment options.

### Key Improvements

- Created optimized multi-stage Dockerfile with proper security hardening
- Enhanced development docker-compose.yml with health checks and improved MongoDB configuration
- Added production-specific docker-compose.prod.yml with resource limits and volume management
- Created Docker helper scripts to simplify common Docker operations
- Added health check API endpoint for container monitoring
- Updated environment variable templates for better documentation
- Created comprehensive .dockerignore file to optimize build times

### Testing Notes

- Tested development environment with MongoDB persistence
- Verified health check endpoint functions correctly
- Confirmed production build optimizations reduce image size
