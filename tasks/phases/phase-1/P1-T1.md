## Task Description

Initialize the Plate boilerplate project using the Payload CMS blank template, which provides a foundation with Next.js 15 App Router and Payload CMS v3 integration. This task involves setting up the project in the root directory, configuring the basic database connection, and ensuring the admin panel is accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project initialized with `npx create-payload-app@latest` using the blank template
- [x] MongoDB connection configured and working
- [x] Admin panel accessible at `/admin` route
- [x] Next.js app structure properly set up
- [x] Basic project files (README, package.json, etc.) customized for the Plate project
- [x] Project successfully runs in development mode

## Dependencies

None - This is the first task of the project.

## Implementation Details

1. Use `npx create-payload-app@latest` in root directory with "blank" template
2. Configure MongoDB connection in .env file
3. Review and customize generated files for Plate project
4. Test admin access and basic functionality
5. Document the structure and configurations
