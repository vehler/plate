# Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement

## Overview

Building on the Payload blank template to establish the core architecture and structure of the Plate boilerplate.

## Goals

- Initialize Plate from blank template using `npx create-payload-app` with blank template selection
- Enhance Docker setup with optimized development and production configurations
- Implement feature-based architecture by restructuring existing collections into `features/core/`
- Add shadcn/ui integration with theme configuration and base components
- Set up automatic collection registration system to replace manual imports
