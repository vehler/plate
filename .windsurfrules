# Windsurf Rules for Plate Project

Always refer to the `prd.md` file for the project requirements and architecture.

## Project Structure Rules

1. **Project Structure**:
   - All source code must reside within a single root `src` folder
   - Follow feature-based modular architecture as outlined in PRD
   - Create new features using the code generation tools once implemented

2. **Component and State Management**:
   - Components should be small, isolated, and stateless whenever possible
   - Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
   - Always check for existing components before creating new ones

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Generate and propose detailed plans before implementation
   - Get approval for plans before starting implementation
   - Update task status when moving between workflow stages

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Server-First Approach**:
   - Prioritize server components over client components
   - Utilize Payload's local API for zero-latency data operations
   - Implement progressive enhancement ensuring functionality without JS

2. **Authentication Systems**:
   - Maintain clear separation between admin and application user authentication
   - Implement proper security practices (HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection)
   - Follow task dependencies for authentication features

3. **Feature Development**:
   - Follow the standardized feature module structure from the PRD
   - Implement automatic registration systems for all features
   - Ensure proper permissions and access control for all features

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Document APIs and extension points thoroughly
   - Include setup guides and examples
